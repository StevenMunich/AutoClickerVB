These steps are for creating an auto-caller in Google Voice.
If you already have a gmail account getting google voice should be easy. 
once you have it you can start on the auto-caller

So what is the point? It ties up phone lines; its like a ddoser for the phone.
Calls then it hangs up, leave this on for hours and people get PISSED.

When you have set up your autocaller you may want to watch TV or do something else for a while, while the victim
is getting call after call. This program will take over the mouse & keyboard so you will not be able to use the computer.
However, the whole point of this program is so you dont have to be on a computer.
