THE INSERT KEY:
Wherever the mouse is the x,y coordinates will be shown. But not copied into the textbox's until "insert" is pressed

2 things you do on a computer: click & type. This program allows you to create your own robot that simulates those 2 plus a wait cmd:
Mouse-Left Click, Right Click, without either the mouse then Moves to X,Y on the screen.
Keyboard - Types anything you want it to
Wait - this is for waiting on other applications to load or anything else.

I have not added a feature that allows users to escape the loop.
The loop will re-run your CMDS after they are finished. Unfortunatly the only
way to escape the loop is to exit the program. Best Advice, once you have
a script that works. SAVE IT

This is not a finished product but is intended for people who want the computer doing its own work for redundant activities
This program makes it easy to create your own bot.

Thank you & I hope you enjoy the program =)
